<h1>Stuff about undertale</h1>

    <p>Undertale is a great game, but there are a few facts that a few people don't know. <br>
    So, I'm gonna put some small trivia on this page :3</p>
  
  <h2> Some small facts</h2>
  
  <ul> <li> The idea for undertale was created <em> after </em> the Idea for 
    deltarune (Undertales successor)</li>
    
  <li> The Flowey boss fight is commonly called omega flowey or photoshop flowey, But in the files it's called <em> Flowey X</em> </li>

    <li>When creating Deltarune, the creator (toby fox) wanted to make an extended version of the mettaton neo bossfight,
    This later involved spamton and became the bossfight <em> Spamton neo </em></li>
  </ul>
  
  <H2> The souls </H2>
  <p> In undertale and deltarune the player character (the soul) semms to have the same sprite, but theres actually a TWO PIXEL <br>
    difference. Look at the attached Image, Can you guess what game its from?</p>

  <H2> The F̴̷̴̻́̐͜Ų̴̴̸̱̊̾Ņ̷̸̴̀́ͅ value</H2>
    <p> In the game there is a value every run has, this is called the FUN value. Each number in the fun value {1-100} adds something (exept 1)</p>
    <ul>
<li>2 to 39: when you have a fun value between 2 and 29 a song called the wrong number song will play in snowdin</li>
<li> 40-45: when your fun value is in this range you will receive a call from sans near papyruses station</li>
<li> 46-50: alphys will call you to order a pizza</li>
